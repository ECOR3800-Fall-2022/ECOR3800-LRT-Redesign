# ECOR3800 - Engineering Economics - Group 1
This project is for the class ECOR3800 - Engineering Economics - Fall 2022 - Carleton University

The purpose of this project is to develop a Request for Proposals (RFP) for the scope of the feasibility of the redesign, following the request of the Ottawa Light rail transit (LRT). The redesign, with the descending order of importance, includes:

- Providing infrastructure for bicycles to park at the station that could serve the student population as well as the community in the Old Ottawa South. (this is the #1 proposal)

- Support small start-up businesses, specifically food trucks that could provide much-needed alternative food options to the Carleton community. 

- Reduce the carbon footprint of food trucks as part of meeting its climate mitigation goals. So, if possible, the Ottawa City Council would like to use the LRT stop site to develop permanent electric hookups for 4-8 food trucks and a seating area. 

- Consider the second most mentioned additional feature for the LRT: a public art project which would highlight the work of local Ottawa artists. 

The team members are:
